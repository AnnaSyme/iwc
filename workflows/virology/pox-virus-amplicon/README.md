# Pox Virus Illumina Amplicon Workflow from half-genomes

This workflow generates a consensus sequence from Illumina-sequenced ARTIC PE data using BWA-MEM for mapping and iVar for consensus sequence generation.

It requires that the pox virus genome has been sequenced in two halves in two separate sequencing runs.
